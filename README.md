# Servlet Cookies Demo
In this project, we are creating 3 links: login, logout and profile. User can't go to profile page until he/she is logged in. If user is logged out, he need to login again to visit profile. Here, we are going to create a login, logout  and  search example using servlet cookies, and we have used sendRedirect() method for search box
